# finalProject-SchoolDatabase
This is the final project for intermediate programming. It builds a sample school database using a hashmap to keep track of students. Please download .jar raw file for working program. This was a school project and is somewhat heavy on error messaging. To insert a student record you must make sure that all fields in the gui are filled out, the remaining options only require the student ID #. For images and more explanations of the program please see the project wiki.
